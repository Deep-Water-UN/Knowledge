# AIS Big Data Hackathon | United Nations

The automatic identification system (AIS) is a tracking system for ships, originally developed for collision avoidance. The data is automatically transmitted every few seconds over very high frequency (VHF) radios from approximately 100,000 vessels worldwide. Allowing for real-time geo-tracking and identification for equipped vessels, the AIS data promises to map and describe certain marine human activities. AIS data provides a big data source of unrivaled quality above and beyond its original application for collision avoidance.

The number of possible applications for this data is enormous, and we believe that it could also be used to support official statistics in monitoring the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and to assist the world in its fight against climate change. To quickly utilize the data to its full potential, we need a surge of creative researchers to come up with equally creative ways to use it!

For this reason, the United Nations Statistics Division, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and UN Global Pulse are jointly, in collaboration with MarineTraffic and consultation with AIS Task Team members, organizing a remote participation Hackathon from 3-6 September — right after the Conference on Big Data for Official Statistics and the winning team will get the chance to present their work at the UN World Data Forum in Bern, Switzerland. So, if you have an idea (and we also recommend a team, preferably interdisciplinary), please use this form to send us an abstract (200 - 400 words) introducing yourself/your team and your idea.
More information about the Hackathon can be found in the concept note for the event. For more information on AIS data, here is a list of case studies.

# What is AIS data ?

The automatic identification system (AIS) is an automatic tracking system that uses transceivers on ships and is used by vessel traffic services (VTS). When satellites are used to detect AIS signatures, the term Satellite-AIS (S-AIS) is used. AIS information supplements marine radar, which continues to be the primary method of collision avoidance for water transport. Although technically and operationally distinct, the ADS-B system is analogous to AIS and performs a similar function for aircraft.




# What applications are AIS data used for ?

•	Collision avoidance
•	Fishing fleet monitoring and control
•	Maritime security
•	Aids to navigation
•	Search and rescue
•	Accident investigation
•	Ocean currents estimates
•	Infrastructure protection
•	Fleet and cargo tracking




# What are the Objectives of the Challenge | UN Goals

•	To not use data for collision avoidance
•	To use data to map human activities
•	To use data to monitor social impact of COVID-19
•	To use data to monitor economic impact of COVID-19
•	To use data to fight against climate change
•	Maintain international peace and security
•	Protect human rights
•	Deliver humanitarian aid
•	Promote sustainable development
•	Uphold international law
